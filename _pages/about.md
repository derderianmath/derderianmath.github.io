Hi! My name is Adrian Derderian, and I am an incoming senior at UCLA pursuing both B.S. and M.A. degrees in pure math through the Departmental Scholars Program. My academic interests lie primarily in algebra and proof formalization. After my expected graduation in Spring 2026, I am excited to continue exploring vast universe of mathematics in graduate school.

Research Experience
=====
- UCLA Computational and Applied Mathematics REU (Summer 2025)
  - Currently developing procedures to unmix spectroscopic frequency comb data into pure constituent compounds using machine learning algorithms
- Directed Reading Program at UCLA (Fall 2024)
  - Studied various topics in algebraic topology under the guidance of a graduate mentor
  - Presented a topological proof of the Nielsen-Schreier Theorem in group theory which states that every subgroup of a free group remains free
- Park City Mathematics Institute Undergraduate Summer School (Summer 2024)
  - Participated in an algebraic topology lecture series that developed tools to compute higher homotopy groups
  - Presented to the PCMI mathematics colloquium a homological algebraic proof of a classification theorem for crystallographic space groups (a generalization of wallpaper groups to n dimensions)
- Polymath Junior REU (Summer 2024)
  - Proved novel results about the classification of k-covers in the game Projective Set using known solutions to the Ramanujan-Nagell equation
