- UCLA Computational and Applied Mathematics REU (Summer 2025)
  - Currently developing procedures to unmix spectroscopic data into pure constituent compounds using machine learning algorithms
- Directed Reading Program at UCLA (Fall 2024)
  - Studied various topics in algebraic topology under the guidance of a graduate mentor
  - Presented a topological proof of the Nielsen-Schreier Theorem in group theory which states that every subgroup of a free group remains free
- Park City Mathematics Institute Undergraduate Summer School (Summer 2024)
  - Participated in an algebraic topology lecture series that developed tools to compute higher homotopy groups
  - Presented a homological algebraic proof of a classification theorem of crystallographic space groups (a generalization of wallpaper groups to n dimensions) to the PCMI mathematics colloquium
- Polymath Junior REU (Summer 2024)
  - Proved novel results about the classification of k-covers in the game Projective Set using the Ramanujan-Nagell equation
